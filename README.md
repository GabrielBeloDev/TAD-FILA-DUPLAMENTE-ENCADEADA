An interactive C implementation of a Doubly Linked List (TAD Lista Duplamente Encadeada), featuring operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

About The Project
This project implements a Doubly Linked List (TAD Lista Duplamente Encadeada) in C. It demonstrates fundamental data structure concepts, offering a hands-on approach to understanding how doubly linked lists function. The implementation supports various operations like adding, removing, and querying elements, as well as listing all elements in the list.

Features
List Initialization: Initialize an empty doubly linked list.
Element Insertion: Add elements at the beginning or end of the list.
Element Removal: Remove specific elements based on criteria (e.g., name).
Element Query: Search and display specific elements in the list.
List Traversal: Traverse and display all elements in the list.
Interactive Menu: A user-friendly command-line interface to interact with the list.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
GCC Compiler: Ensure you have GCC installed to compile the program.
Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal:


gcc -o main main.c tad_lista_duplamente_encadeada.c
Execution
To run the program, use:


./main
Usage
The program employs a simple menu-driven interface. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various operations on the doubly linked list.
